                    <p>This game evolves very often, this should be used as a <b>GUIDELINE ONLY</b>, always ask questions to actual players don't just follow any guide, including this one. It's always good to know *why* something is working so well, that way you can start learning patterns and meta changes yourself too.</p>

                    <p>When choosing a set, it's important to keep in mind how many materials you can farm. Ashbringer is a very strong set and one of the 2 must-haves for any high end player, the other being Paladin. However, Ashbringer's legendary materials come from Portal which is the most expensive and limited source of materials.</p>

                <p><strong>After the top 2</strong>, the order is going to be different for everyone. Preferences play a big part in this but also material farming and the gear choices of each player are going to be different. I can't stress this enough, <strong>use this list as a general guideline only</strong>, double check in #gear-comparisons on the <a href="https://discord.gg/hustle-prime">Hustle Prime Discord</a> server to make sure.</p>

Not to mention being immune to Angel Wand's mind control (only the Paladin itself). Build your Paladin 4-set and stop. Make Paladin ring, necklace, armor and armor soul. 6-set Paladin isn't that big of an upgrade and wastes a lot of your time building it for a minimal increase in performance.</p>

                            <p>Sturdy tank with a lot of control but does near 0 damage. Paladin does near 0 damage too but Paladin gives an important buff, Bastion does not.</p>

                            <p>Has the potential to be amazing, but this requires having fewer mages than the opponent. You're essentially cutting off your own 2 legs to cut off 1 leg of the enemy in the current meta.</p>

                    <p>This game evolves very often, this should be used as a <b>GUIDELINE ONLY</b>, always ask questions to actual players don't just follow any guide, including this one. It's always good to know *why* something is working so well, that way you can start learning patterns and meta changes yourself too.</p>
