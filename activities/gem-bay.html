                        It is a place where you can collect certain items that also come into play once reaching TR8.

                    Diamonds are the game’s currency. They can be used to purchase just about anything that you want in the game.

                        Every day you can enter Gem Bay once for free, twice if you have Premium. 
                        After your free journey has been used up, you will need to spend food to go on additional journeys. 
                        You may purchase up to 2 additional food runs, any after that cost diamonds.
                        <br><br>
                        I strongly recommend that you take full advantage of the free journey. 
                        The only potential drawback to entering the bay for free is that you could end up expending spells.

                    When you enter Gem Bay, you are prompted to select up to 12 fighters to bring with you on your  journey, and up to 9 spells.

                    You also can bring up to 12 spells on your journey with Premium, rather than the standard 9 spells from a non premium run.

                        There is no disadvantage to bringing a full complement of 12 fighters on your journey with you. 
                        You will only use 6 at a time, and so the more options you have available to build this team of 6, the better you will perform.

                    You can pull fighters from any part of the castle. There is a handy “Deploy the best ones” button that you can click to select the 12 best fighters. 
                    The game seems to select the best based on the dweller’s fighting power. This is usually a good idea, and can save you some time, 
                    but be aware that it selects dwellers based on their current equipment, and so it might not necessarily select the highest-leveled fighters.
                    <br><br>
                    You will need to equip your fighters as desired before you click the Confirm button. Once you confirm your journey squad, you will not be able to adjust their equipment.

                        The introduction of Gem Bay makes spells much more important. 
                        Previously they were only useful in PvP, PvE, and Portal. But now you can bring up to 12 spells with you on your journey. 
                        These spells can be selected from both your Combat Spells (equipped) and from your Prepared Spells (inventory).
                        <br><br>
                        Any spells that you don’t use will be returned to you once your journey is over.
                        <br><br><br><br>
                        <b>TIP:</b><br> After selecting your fighters and spells, go back to your castle to craft new spells!
                        During the run, you castle doesn't know that your spells will return and when you are finished and all the left-over spells come back, you will have more spells in your arsenal!

                    There are also 3 special spells that can be purchased in Gem Bay. They are similar to Portal spells in that they are unique to Gem Bay, 
                    and they can only be used in that setting. You can purchase them for diamonds after you start fighting, 
                    or you can purchase them before the fights with kraken tokens in the Gem Bay Shop.

                        For each battle, you can select up to 6 fighters (out of the 12 brought into Gem Bay) to form your squad. 
                        You can also select up to 6 spells. You will be given the opportunity to both hire Mercenaries and buy Spells in between each battle.
